# 1. Introduction
The real estate industry refers to property or tangible assets, for example land and houses. Real estate such as building a house is a good investment because it has many advantages, some of which are:
  - Passive income: through property rental activities
  - protection against inflation
  - including a safe and stable type of asset
  - potential value appreciation: tends to increase in value

The price of one property can be different from other properties. Several factors influence the price difference:

1. **Location** <br/>
Property prices in the city center tend to be more expensive than in the suburbs.
2. **age and model of building**<br/>
The younger the building, the higher the demand. Meanwhile, the newer the model of a property, the higher the demand as well.
3. **landform**
4. **rising trend in property prices around**
5. **building materials** <br/>
The better the materials used to build the property, the higher the selling price.
6. **accessibility** <br/>
7. **demographics**<br/>
8. **other macroeconomics and microeconomics factors**

Machine Learning can help optimize the property price prediction process based on property features, profiles or characteristics.
